   <h2><b>Work Projects:</b></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Contracted by the economic research and consulting company Prognos AG to completely rewrite and extend their energy market model. The agent-based model simulates the long term development of energy prices, power plant scheduling and co2 emissions in the european energy market. This has been my main project for the past years.</li>
    <li>Developing multiple Add-Ins for Powerpoint and Excel.</li>
    <li>Various small consulting projects about topics intersecting the energy market and software development (e.g. risk assessment of IoT devices and smart-charging electric cars for the energy grid; potential benefits and issues of using blockchain in the energy market).</li>
    <li>Planning and administration of the amateur tournaments with ~1000 participants at the Dreamhack Germany LANs 2017-2019 together with a small team.</li>
    <li>Setting up livestreams for various presentations, panel discussions and other events.</li>
