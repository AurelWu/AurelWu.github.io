    A fully documented library for Unity which makes working with hexagonal maps effortless and intuitive. Includes support for tiles,edges and corners as well as periodic maps. <br>
    You can also find a WebGL Demo of some features/applications in its obsolete predecessor version (I didnâ€™t find time to create similar examples for the updated version yet)
