    <h4>Hexagonal Map Library:</h4><br>
    <a href="https://aurelwu.github.io/">https://aurelwu.github.io/</a> <br>  
    A fully documented library for Unity which makes working with hexagonal maps effortless and intuitive. Includes support for tiles,edges and corners as well as periodic maps. <br/>
    <br/>You can also find a WebGL Demo of some features/applications in its obsolete predecessor version (I didnâ€™t find time to create similar examples for the updated version yet)<br>
