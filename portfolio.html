   <h2><b>Work Projects:</b></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Completely rewriting and extending the Energy Market Model for a leading german economic research and consulting company. This agent-based model simulates the long term development of energy prices , power plant scheduling and co2 emissions in the european energy grid. This has been my main project for the past years.</li>

    <li>Various small consulting projects about topics which intersect the energy market and software development (e.g. risk assessment of IoT devices and smart-charging electric cars for the energy grid; potential benefits and issues of using blockchain in the energy market)</li>
    <li>Planning and administration of the amateur tournaments with ~1000 participants at the Dreamhack Leipzig LANs 2017-2019 together with a small team.</li>
