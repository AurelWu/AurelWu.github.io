<div class="textblock"><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This library makes working with hexagonal grids an intuitive and easy process. It abstracts the math behind a hexagonal coordinate system completely away and provides many useful methods like <a class="el" href="class_wunderwunsch_1_1_hex_map_library_1_1_hex.html#aa7118b1cf473301900bc81d8b0774b17">GetLine</a>, <a class="el" href="class_wunderwunsch_1_1_hex_map_library_1_1_hex.html#a6e0ae3db35ec6ca3d6645a6be84254fe">GetRing</a>, <a class="el" href="class_wunderwunsch_1_1_hex_map_library_1_1_hex.html#a7c005178b0211959d52c22efcd3d8106">GetDistance</a> and many more while accounting for map borders and wrap-around logic. <br />
</p>
<p>While it already supports many commonly used map shapes, it can be easily extended to work with more exotic map layouts. <br />
The visual representation of the hexagonal map is not part of the library as that is highly implementation specific. However, there are some sample scenes included which you can use as a starting point for visualizing a hexagonal map. It is structured in a way that you do not need to know the details of hexagonal-grid-coordinate systems, but I still recommend reading Amit Patel's great page about hexagonal grids: <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/</a> at some point.</p>
<p><b>This package includes examples which will provide a quick introduction to the library. These examples are also described in detail in this documentation</b> </p><div class="image">

</div>
<p> <br />
</p><h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>The library has a few restrictions to keep the code and usage as simple as possible. These restrictions will be no issue for the vast majority of projects and for those affected, it should be easy enough to change. (Feel free to contact me at <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'aur'+'el'+'wue'+'ns'+'ch@'+'gm'+'ail'+'.c'+'om'; return false;">aurel<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>wuen<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>sch@g<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>mail<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>.com</a>) if you need advice regarding those limitations. These are the restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>hexagons have a radius of 1 (center to corner) - that concerns only the logic side of things you can still visualize it differently.</li>
<li>it only supports Tiles and Edges, not Corners. (we use the term "Tile" for the area/face of the hexagon, edges and corners are hopefully self explanatory)</li>
<li>it only works for "pointy-top" hexagons, which are by far more commonly used in computer games than flat-top hexagons . <div class="image">
<img src="PointyAndFlatTopHexagon.png" alt="PointyAndFlatTopHexagon.png"/>
<div class="caption">

 <br />
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Different Approaches possible : Generics, creating a child class or keeping the data separate.</h3>
<p>The following three approaches are all demonstrated in the included examples. <br />
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Using the generic <a class="el" href="class_wunderwunsch_1_1_hex_map_library_1_1_generic_1_1_hex_map.html">HexMap&lt;Tile&gt;</a> and <a class="el" href="class_wunderwunsch_1_1_hex_map_library_1_1_generic_1_1_hex_map.html">HexMap&lt;Tile,Edge&gt;</a> classes which allows you full flexibility to use any object as a tile or edge. The HexMap will pass that generic argument through to <a class="el" href="class_wunderwunsch_1_1_hex_map_library_1_1_generic_1_1_tile.html">Tile&lt;T&gt;</a> and <a class="el" href="class_wunderwunsch_1_1_hex_map_library_1_1_generic_1_1_edge.html">Edge&lt;E&gt;</a> who both inherit from a non-generic base class which contains information about the position and index of it.</li>
<li>An alternative approach is to derive from the the non-generic <a class="el" href="class_wunderwunsch_1_1_hex_map_library_1_1_hex_map_base.html">HexMapBase</a> or <a class="el" href="class_wunderwunsch_1_1_hex_map_library_1_1_hex_map_base_with_edges.html">HexMapBaseWithEdges</a> class and create a concrete implementation. <br />
</li>
<li>Finally it is also possible to just use an instance of HexMapBase/HexMapBaseWithEdges and keep all possible Map Data in arrays which are aligned with how the tile and edge positions are indexed.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are surely even more possibilities so pick the one which suits your needs the most.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The following examples explain in detail use an approach with generics. Additionally, functionally identical scripts with the 2 other approaches mentioned before are included in the package for the first 3 examples. All these examples use a very simple way to visualise the map which is far from perfect in many ways, especially when it comes to performance. Please keep in mind that this library is not tied to a certain visualisation and you can easily use procedurally generated meshes, Environments created in 3D modelling software or even handpainted backgrounds instead.</p>
<p>These examples are kept as simple and as possible so you can focus on the usage of the library, this code is by no means intended to be used in production code and is not suitable structured for that but for ease of understanding. You will also notice some duplicate code between them, that is consciously done to keep each example self-contained.</p>
